"""Blender importer for native SketchUp (.skp) files, built on OpenSKP.

Uses openskp's ``build_instanced_scene()`` rather than its flattened
``build_scene()`` - the former keeps each unique component/group
DEFINITION's geometry as one local-space mesh plus a separate list of
placements, instead of baking every placement into its own copy of the
vertex data. That maps directly onto Blender's own collection-instancing
model: one Collection per unique definition, referenced by an Empty
(``instance_type='COLLECTION'``) per placement. A component placed 1,000
times costs one mesh, not 1,000 - unlike a flat triangle-soup import,
editing the source mesh updates every placement at once, matching how
SketchUp's own components behave.

Coordinates: openskp's InstancedScene is already metres, glTF Y-up
(positions/normals) with a 16-element column-major matrix per node -
Blender is also metres but Z-up, so every matrix gets one fixed
axis-conversion matrix multiplied in (see _YUP_TO_ZUP below), applied once
per node rather than per vertex.

Loose edges (construction lines/structural framing - a light-gauge-steel
member is routinely drawn this way, not as a solid) come from the SAME
instanced scene via ``InstancedScene.curve_resources``, imported as
separate edges-only Mesh Objects (no faces, so Blender renders them as
plain lines) placed the same way and cached the same way as the mesh
resources above - a definition can have both a mesh_resource_id and a
curve_resource_id at once. Found missing by testing this importer against
a real structural-framing file (93 of 145 definitions were entirely or
partly loose-edge, silently invisible before openskp gained
InstancedCurveResource support).

Editing the source geometry: every unique definition's master mesh/curve
object lives in its own Collection, all gathered under one
"<filename> (source geometry)" Collection which is excluded from the View
Layer (Collection.children + a LayerCollection.exclude = True, found via
_find_layer_collection) - kept out of the viewport/render at its
local-space origin, where it would otherwise show up duplicated on top of
the real, placed instances, while staying visible and selectable in the
Outliner. This is the same pattern Blender's own manual recommends for a
source/library collection feeding instances. To edit one: find it under
that collection in the Outliner, enable its checkbox (un-excluding it),
select the object, Tab into Edit Mode as normal - the edit affects every
placement at once, matching how SketchUp's own components behave.
Selecting a visible placement Empty and pressing Tab does nothing on its
own (an Empty has no mesh data of its own to edit) - this is what a real
user reported as "cannot access Edit Mode" (github#3), traced to there
being no way to even select the right object in the first place (the
source collections were entirely unlinked before this), not a limitation
of Edit Mode itself.

Layers (SketchUp calls them "tags"): every placement Empty is linked into
a Collection named for its own resolved InstancedNode.layer, one per
distinct layer in the file, all direct children of the root Collection
(separate from sources_collection above - a layer is a property of a
PLACEMENT, not of the definition it references, since the same
definition can appear on different layers in different places, so
per-layer grouping only makes sense at the placement level). A layer
hidden in the source file (openskp's InstancedScene.layer_hidden, keyed
by layer name) hides its Collection the same way - Collection.
hide_viewport/hide_render, the ordinary Outliner eye/camera toggles - not
the exclude-from-View-Layer mechanism sources_collection uses, since a
hidden layer is still meant to be a normal, working part of the scene,
just not shown right now.

Materials: each mesh resource's per-triangle material_index (resolved by
openskp's build_instanced_scene() into InstancedScene.gltf_materials, a
glTF-style pbrMetallicRoughness list - the same resolution already used
for openskp's other glTF-shaped exports, just never consumed by this
addon before now) becomes a real Blender Material per unique color/alpha
combination (Principled BSDF Base Color + Alpha, cached in
material_cache so repeated colors across definitions share one Material
datablock), assigned as a mesh material slot with per-polygon
material_index set to match - so a component with several differently
colored faces keeps that per-face variation in Blender, not one flat
color for the whole object. Import only for now; export does not write
materials back out.

Textured materials: each mesh's own UV coordinates (LocalPrimitive.uvs -
already resolved by openskp per vertex, just never read by this addon
before now) are written into a real UV layer, and a material whose
gltf_materials entry carries a pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorTexture
gets a real Image Texture node wired into Base Color (and Alpha, for an
image with its own alpha channel), built from InstancedScene.textures'
raw image bytes (PNG/JPEG only - the same restriction glTF itself has)
via a temp file + Image.pack() (embeds the bytes into the .blend itself,
so the temp file isn't left as a dangling external reference) - cached
by texture index in image_cache so the same source image shared by
several materials/objects loads exactly once. A textured material's
resolved solid baseColorFactor (SketchUp's own paint-bucket average
color) is still what Solid-shading and material_cache dedup key off of;
only the shader's actual Base Color input differs when a texture image
is available.
